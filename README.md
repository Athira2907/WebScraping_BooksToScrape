# WebScraping_BooksToScrape
* Using python libraries, requests and BeautifulSoup (from bs4) data was scraped from static webpage Books to Scrape.
* I scraped data of nearly 500 books for example, title,price,rating of book and saved as lists.
* After one page, to go to next page, the next button link was added to original url to load it.
* Using pandas the lists were saved as a DataFrame and then into excel document.
